Download all data
Take the stations and the time, member type
Get information about stations
Build multiple trees based on stations, each tree in different order
Tree for bikes on the way to the station
Tree for bikes that are expected to leave the station
Trying to predict number of bikes needed
Create NN based on all the trees
Compare results of random forest, forest with NN or pure NN.


Maybe create a connection between stations based on GEO

Current Flow:
Get all data for everyone
Create training and test data - use the same in every computer
Create the trees based on the training data:
    Should we split the data?
    Need to decide on attributes for special trees
    Same trees for everyone?
Train NN:
    multiple training
    change parameters
